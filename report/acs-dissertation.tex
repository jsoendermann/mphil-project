% TODO don't stop time spent scoring
% TODO roc_auc_score to score
% TODO convert sparse arff files to non sparse
% TODO rnd forest is bad at data thats heavily pos or neg
% TODO describe gradent problems
% TODO describe classifier scoring mechanism
% TODO optimisation: gpml's didn't work, rolled my own based on slice optimisation; explain grad based optimi, show nlml func to justify that it's simple
% TODO implement better optimiser based on gradients
% TODO comparing model evidence
% TODO look at spearmint
%
% TODO TODO start saving graphs!!

% TODO If you use purely-numeric bibliographic references, do not forget to still mention authorsâ€™ surnames

% TODO Appendices should be avoided where possible, but may be appropriate in some cases
% TODO mention ec2

% TODO Where a project has as its main aim the production of a piece of software, the project report should state clearly what test procedures were adopted and should include test output
% TODO The report should explicitly describe the starting point for the project, making clear what existing software or other resources were used

% TODO Datasets
%- Autoweka data taken from their website (how were those datasets selected?)
%- merge training and test arffs using weka cmd line
%python:
%- load using scipy.io.arff.loadarff
%- vectorise (one-of-K) using sklearn.feature_extraction.DictVectorizer

- context
- motivation
- general overview
% TODO context (why did you do it (motivation), what was the hoped-for outcome (aims) --- as well as trying to give a brief overview of what you actually did)


% TODO It's often useful to bring forward some ``highlights'' into  this chapter (e.g.\ some particularly compelling results, or  a particularly interesting finding). 

% TODO It's also traditional to give an outline of the rest of the document, although without care this can appear formulaic  and tedious. Your call. 


\chapter{Background} 
- ML + algos
- GPs/GPML

% TODO A more extensive coverage of what's required to understand your work. In general you should assume the reader has a good undergraduate degree in computer science, but is not necessarily an expert in the particular area you've been working on. Hence this chapter may need to summarise some ``text book'' material. 



\chapter{Related Work} 

- hyper param optim
- multi armed bandits

% TODO This chapter covers relevant (and typically, recent) research which you build upon (or improve upon). There are two complementary goals for this chapter: - to show that you know and understand the state of the art; and to put your work in context

% TODO Ideally you can tackle both together by providing a critique of related work, and describing what is insufficient (and how you do better!)




\chapter{Design and Implementation} 


1. modelling
- optimisation
- 1d/2d

2. decisions

\chapter{Evaluation} 
- model evidence
- testing
- how well it performs


\chapter{Summary and Conclusions} 

% TODO Depending on the length of your work, and  how well you write, you may not need a summary here. You will generally want to draw some conclusions, and point to potential future work.
