% TODO context (why did you do it (motivation), what was the hoped-for outcome (aims) --- as well as trying to give a brief overview of what you actually did)


% TODO It's often useful to bring forward some ``highlights'' into  this chapter (e.g.\ some particularly compelling results, or  a particularly interesting finding). 

% TODO It's also traditional to give an outline of the rest of the document, although without care this can appear formulaic  and tedious. Your call. 


\chapter{Background} 

A more extensive coverage of what's required to understand your 
work. In general you should assume the reader has a good undergraduate 
degree in computer science, but is not necessarily an expert in 
the particular area you've been working on. Hence this chapter 
may need to summarise some ``text book'' material. 



\chapter{Related Work} 

This chapter covers relevant (and typically, recent) research 
which you build upon (or improve upon). There are two complementary 
goals for this chapter: 
\begin{enumerate} 
  \item to show that you know and understand the state of the art; and 
  \item to put your work in context
\end{enumerate} 

Ideally you can tackle both together by providing a critique of
related work, and describing what is insufficient (and how you do
better!)

The related work chapter should usually come either near the front or
near the back of the dissertation. The advantage of the former is that
you get to build the argument for why your work is important before
presenting your solution(s) in later chapters; the advantage of the
latter is that don't have to forward reference to your solution too
much. The correct choice will depend on what you're writing up, and
your own personal preference.



\chapter{Design and Implementation} 

This chapter may be called something else\ldots but in general 
the idea is that you have one (or a few) ``meat'' chapters which
describe the work you did in technical detail. 


\chapter{Evaluation} 

For any practical projects, you should almost certainly have
some kind of evaluation, and it's often useful to separate 
this out into its own chapter. 


\chapter{Summary and Conclusions} 

As you might imagine: summarizes the dissertation, and draws 
any conclusions. Depending on the length of your work, and 
how well you write, you may not need a summary here. 

You will generally want to draw some conclusions, and point
to potential future work.
