In this project, we consider methods to run machine learning algorithms at different degrees of approximation to handle constraints on runtime. We take an empirical approach that uses Bayesian optimisation to search for optimal trade-offs between statistical and computational efficiency. 

We model the relationship between the degree of approximateness at which a machine learning algorithm runs and the quality of its predictions with a Gaussian process using a custom covariance functions. Based on this model, we develop heuristics that can find solutions to learning problems within given time constraints.
